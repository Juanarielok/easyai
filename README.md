Thank you to all creators and contributors for facilitating and contributing to the democratization of Artificial Intelligence: lack simplicity and accesibility is oftentimes a barrier between AI and non-tech folk; however, AI Easy reduces this gap to make everything easier ❤️



## Installation and Setup Environment
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font
